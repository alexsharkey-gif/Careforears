						<h2>Our Story</h2>

                                        <p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic09.png" alt="Alex Sharkey, founder of Care For Ears">
                                    
                                            <p>Care For Ears was founded in 2026 by Alex Sharkey, a qualified and registered paramedic with a passion for providing safe, patient-centred care. </p>
                                           <p> The idea for Care For Ears came from a personal experience, when a close relative struggled to access a reliable, high-quality ear wax removal service. Appointments were difficult to find, information was unclear, and home visits were rarely offered - even when mobility or comfort made travelling challenging. It quickly became clear that there was a real gap in care.</p>
                                           <p>Based in Crowborough, Sussex, Care For Ears serves clients all over Sussex & Kent. </p>
                                           <p> With a background in frontline healthcare, Alex recognised the importance of combining clinical standards with convenience and compassion. Care For Ears was created to provide professional microsuction ear wax removal delivered either in the comfort of your own home or in a clinic setting, without compromising on safety or quality.</p>
                                           <p> We believe healthcare should be transparent, accessible and fairly priced. That’s why our <a href="prices.html"> pricing is clear and upfront,</a> with no hidden charges, and every appointment is given the time and care it deserves.</p>
                                            <p>As a CQC registered provider, we operate in line with nationally regulated standards for safety, infection control and patient wellbeing. This commitment ensures that every patient receives treatment they can trust - delivered with professionalism, respect and reassurance.</p>
                                            <p>At Care For Ears, our focus is simple: high-quality ear care, delivered properly, by a healthcare professional who understands the importance of doing things the right way.
                                        </p>
