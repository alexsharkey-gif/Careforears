								<h2>About Microsuction</h2>
									<p>Microsuction is the gold standard method for ear wax removal and is widely used by private clinics and the NHS. It is a gentle, precise technique that uses low-pressure suction under direct visual guidance to safely remove excess ear wax.
										<p>Our service is suitable for adults of all ages and is ideal for anyone experiencing blocked ears, reduced hearing, discomfort or tinnitus caused by excess ear wax.</p>

									<h3>How long does it take?</h3>
									<p>Appointments in clinic can be as quick as 15-minutes. </p>
									<p> Home appointments take around 30-minutes to account for set up.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<i class="fa-regular fa-calendar fa-xl" style="color: #63E6BE;"></i>
									<p></p>
									<h3>How often do i need microsuction?</h3>
									<p>There’s no single answer that suits everyone - how often you need ear microsuction depends on how quickly your ears produce wax and whether you’re prone to blockages.</p>
										<p>For most people, earwax clears naturally and doesn’t need regular removal. However, some people produce more wax or have narrower ear canals, meaning wax can build up over time.</p>
								</li>
								<li >
								<i class="fa-solid fa-shield-heart fa-xl" style="color: #63E6BE;"></i>
								<p></p>
									<h3>Is Microsuction safe?</h3>
									<p>Yes - when carried out by a trained professional, ear microsuction is considered one of the safest and most effective methods of earwax removal.</p>
									<P>Microsuction is performed under direct visual guidance, allowing wax to be removed precisely and gently. Unlike syringing, no water is used, which reduces the risk of infection, dizziness, or damage to the ear.
									Before any treatment, your ears are examined to make sure microsuction is suitable for you.</p>
								</li>
								<li><i class="fa-solid fa-headphones fa-lg" style="color: #63E6BE;"></i><p></p>
									<h3>Can microsuction improve my hearing?</h3>
									<p>Yes — if earwax is causing a blockage, microsuction can lead to an immediate improvement in hearing.</p>
									<p>Many people notice sounds becoming clearer and louder straight after treatment. If your hearing does not improve, we can advise whether a hearing test or further assessment may be helpful.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<i class="fa-solid fa-eye-dropper fa-xl" style="color: #63E6BE;"></i>
									<p></p>
									<h3>Do I need to use olive oil ear drops before my appointment?</h3>
									<p>In many cases, ear drops are helpful but not always essential. </p>
										<p>If your earwax is hard or impacted, using olive oil drops for a few days before your appointment can make removal easier and more comfortable. However, if your wax is soft, microsuction can often be performed without pre-treatment.</p>
										<p>If you’re unsure, we can advise you when you book or assess your ears on the day.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<i class="fa-solid fa-circle-exclamation fa-xl" style="color: #63E6BE;"></i>
									<p></p>
									<h3>Does microsuction hurt?</h3>
									<p>Microsuction should not be painful. Most people find it comfortable, although you may notice some loud sounds during the procedure and a mild sensation of pressure.</p>
									<p>If at any point you feel discomfort, the procedure can be paused or adjusted. We always work at a pace that feels comfortable for you.</p>
